I am a senior computer vision algorithm engineer with experience at Tencent and JD. I have worked on multiple large-scale computer vision projects, including industrial vision inspection, OCR, video understanding and retrieval, and digital humans. Currently, my focus is on image and video generation.

In the past, my focus was on developing practical algorithms to meet project requirements, with little emphasis on publishing research papers. However, I occasionally wrote blog posts to help engineers easily understand complex algorithms. Here are two blog posts I wrote about diffusion modelsï¼š
